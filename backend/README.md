# backend
This folder is for the backend of the project. This is the part the user will not get to see and is the part that should be managed on a server or similar.

~~The intention is to do this part in node.js.~~
Due to a sickness-induced developer swap this will be done in Python using FastAPI.

This backend has been found to require Python 3.11 or later.
